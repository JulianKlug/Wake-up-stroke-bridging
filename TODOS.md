## Declare an explicit dtype for the CTP volume columns in Stage 1's contract

**Surfaced by:** the engineering review of `specs/stage3_derived_variables.md`, 2026-08-10 (§20 R5
and §13 there).

**What.** Give `core_ml`, `tmax6_ml` and `penumbra_ml` a declared `dtype` in
`config.COLUMN_CONTRACT`, so they enter `READ_DTYPES` like every other numeric analysis column, and
decide between `float64` and the nullable `Float64` as part of it.

**Why.** All three currently pass `dtype=None`, so pandas infers, and the inferred dtype depends on
the file rather than on the contract:

```
  core_ml from data/…v7….xlsx            float64   (one record has no core volume)
  core_ml from tests/fixture_schema.xlsx  int64     (both its values are integers)
```

That asymmetry is not cosmetic — it decides which Stage 3 masks do work. Per Stage 3 §3.1, `float64`
**absorbs** missing in a comparison (`NaN > 5.0` is `False`), so `_core_above_median`'s
`.mask(core.isna())` is the one mask in Stage 3 that is load-bearing today; the identical-looking call
in `_dichotomies` is redundant because `mrs_90d` is declared `Int64` and propagates. A reader who does
not know which column is which will draw the wrong conclusion about both. Declaring the dtype makes
Stage 3 §3.1's table a property of the contract rather than of whichever workbook was loaded.

**Pros.** One dtype per analysis column regardless of source. Removes the class of surprise where a
test frame and the workbook exercise different branches of the same line. Makes a future stage that
*does* depend on the dtype (Stage 6's design matrix, Stage 10's resampling) safe to write against the
contract.

**Cons.** It is a Stage 1 amendment, so it touches `READ_DTYPES`, Stage 2's A6 plausible-range checks,
and Stage 1's own §9.9 read-contract tests. `Float64` versus `float64` is a real decision and not a
detail: nullable `Float64` would make `core > median` propagate `<NA>` instead of absorbing, which
changes `_core_above_median`'s mask from load-bearing to redundant and makes Stage 3 §6.3's
justification stale. Whichever is chosen, Stage 3 §3.1, §6.3, §13 and §18's dtype rows must be updated
in the same commit.

**Depends on / blocked by.** Nothing technically. Deliberately deferred until **after Stage 3 lands**:
Stage 3 §18 records the current dtypes as verified facts and §12.10/§12.12 are written against them, so
changing the contract mid-implementation would invalidate the spec the implementation is being checked
against. Do it as its own commit, with the Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 spec edits included.

**Status: unblocked.** Stage 3 landed on 2026-08-10. The tests this will move are now concrete rather
than anticipated — `test_derive.py`'s `test_without_the_mask_the_missing_core_joins_the_below_median_group`
asserts `core_ml` is `float64` as its stated premise, and `test_the_fixture_reaches_every_entry` asserts
the fixture's is `int64`. Both are deliberate records of today's asymmetry, and both must be revisited by
whoever declares the dtype — the first one's whole point disappears if `Float64` is chosen.
