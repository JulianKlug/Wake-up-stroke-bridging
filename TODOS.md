## Declare an explicit dtype for the CTP volume columns in Stage 1's contract

**Surfaced by:** the engineering review of `specs/stage3_derived_variables.md`, 2026-08-10 (§20 R5
and §13 there).

**What.** Give `core_ml`, `tmax6_ml` and `penumbra_ml` a declared `dtype` in
`config.COLUMN_CONTRACT`, so they enter `READ_DTYPES` like every other numeric analysis column, and
decide between `float64` and the nullable `Float64` as part of it.

**Why.** All three currently pass `dtype=None`, so pandas infers, and the inferred dtype depends on
the file rather than on the contract:

```
  core_ml from data/…v7….xlsx            float64   (one record has no core volume)
  core_ml from tests/fixture_schema.xlsx  int64     (both its values are integers)
```

That asymmetry is not cosmetic — it decides which Stage 3 masks do work. Per Stage 3 §3.1, `float64`
**absorbs** missing in a comparison (`NaN > 5.0` is `False`), so `_core_above_median`'s
`.mask(core.isna())` is the one mask in Stage 3 that is load-bearing today; the identical-looking call
in `_dichotomies` is redundant because `mrs_90d` is declared `Int64` and propagates. A reader who does
not know which column is which will draw the wrong conclusion about both. Declaring the dtype makes
Stage 3 §3.1's table a property of the contract rather than of whichever workbook was loaded.

**Pros.** One dtype per analysis column regardless of source. Removes the class of surprise where a
test frame and the workbook exercise different branches of the same line. Makes a future stage that
*does* depend on the dtype (Stage 6's design matrix, Stage 10's resampling) safe to write against the
contract.

**Cons.** It is a Stage 1 amendment, so it touches `READ_DTYPES`, Stage 2's A6 plausible-range checks,
and Stage 1's own §9.9 read-contract tests. `Float64` versus `float64` is a real decision and not a
detail: nullable `Float64` would make `core > median` propagate `<NA>` instead of absorbing, which
changes `_core_above_median`'s mask from load-bearing to redundant and makes Stage 3 §6.3's
justification stale. Whichever is chosen, Stage 3 §3.1, §6.3, §13 and §18's dtype rows must be updated
in the same commit.

**Depends on / blocked by.** Nothing technically. Deliberately deferred until **after Stage 3 lands**:
Stage 3 §18 records the current dtypes as verified facts and §12.10/§12.12 are written against them, so
changing the contract mid-implementation would invalidate the spec the implementation is being checked
against. Do it as its own commit, with the Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 spec edits included.

**Status: unblocked.** Stage 3 landed on 2026-08-10. The tests this will move are now concrete rather
than anticipated — `test_derive.py`'s `test_without_the_mask_the_missing_core_joins_the_below_median_group`
asserts `core_ml` is `float64` as its stated premise, and `test_the_fixture_reaches_every_entry` asserts
the fixture's is `int64`. Both are deliberate records of today's asymmetry, and both must be revisited by
whoever declares the dtype — the first one's whole point disappears if `Float64` is chosen.

## Make the Stage 3 audit-inventory test positional instead of a tail slice

**Surfaced by:** the engineering review of `specs/stage4_eligibility_classification.md`, 2026-08-12
(§20 defect 1 there).

**What.** `test_derive.py:714`'s `test_the_six_entries_appear_with_the_declared_kinds_and_steps_in_order`
reads `[(e.kind, e.step) for e in audit.entries][-len(_STAGE_3_INVENTORY):]` — the last six entries,
whatever they are. Replace the tail slice with an index captured before the calls, the way
`test_derives_four_entries_precede_derive_cohorts_two` two lines below it already does.

**Why.** The test's helper is `_full_pipeline()` = `load → derive → derive_cohort`, which never calls
`classify`, so Stage 4 leaves it green and Stage 4 must not touch it (its T6 promises "no test edited
except the two moved", and that promise is the check on §10's ledger). But that is an accident of the
helper, not a property of the assertion. The real pipeline is

```
  load  →  derive  →  classify  →  Stage 5 restrictions  →  derive_cohort
           4 entries    1 entry                              2 entries
```

so the moment any test exercises the real order, `[-6:]` spans the eligibility entry and the
assertion compares the wrong six. It fails loudly if the entry lands in the middle and — worse —
could pass while describing a pipeline nobody runs.

Measured, not assumed: `load(FIXTURE)` appends 6 entries (7 on the workbook; the seventh is
`observation` / `onset_to_groin_999`), `derive()` appends 4, `derive_cohort()` appends 2.

**Pros.** The assertion becomes about what Stage 3 appended rather than about what happened to be
last. Removes a trap that only springs during Stage 5, when attention is elsewhere. One-line change.

**Cons.** It edits a Stage 3 test outside Stage 4's scope, which is exactly why it is deferred here
rather than folded in — Stage 4's T6 verification depends on that file being untouched.

**Depends on / blocked by.** Do it **with Stage 5**, in the commit that first builds the real
pipeline order, so the fix and the thing it protects against land together. Not before: landing it
during Stage 4 would break T6's verification step.

## Correct Stage 4 §4.2 and Definition of done 9: a fill on E5 is a no-op, not a bug

**Surfaced by:** implementing `specs/stage4_eligibility_classification.md`, 2026-08-12, while working
Definition of done 9 — the one item of the thirteen that could not be satisfied.

**What.** Two statements in the Stage 4 spec are false against pandas 2.3.3, and they contradict the
spec's own §3.1 and §18:

- **§4.2** — "`.fillna(False)` on E5 would convert 'this patient's arm was never recorded' from
  *caught* into *ignored*", and E4/E5 are "the one place in this module where a fill would be a bug
  rather than belt-and-braces".
- **Definition of done 9** — "A `.fillna(False)` pasted onto E5's mask has been **seen to make a test
  fail** — 12.3's missing-exposure half."

Both rest on E5's mask being able to carry `<NA>`. It cannot. Measured:

```
  pd.Series([0, 1, 2, pd.NA], dtype="Int64")
    ~s.isin((0, 1))            → [False, False, True, True]   dtype boolean, NO <NA>
    ~s.isin((0, 1)).fillna(…)  → identical
```

So the fill is a **pure no-op**: pasting it onto E5 changes no behaviour and makes no test fail. This
was confirmed by running DoD 9's cycle — six of the seven break/restore cycles behaved as the spec
says; this one could not, because there is nothing to break.

**Why it happened.** §3.1's *third* fact — `isin` returns `False` for `<NA>` and never `<NA>` — was
added by the §20 engineering review of 2026-08-12 ("The one substantive addition to §3.1 is a third
fact"). §4.2's sentence and DoD 9 predate it and were not reconciled with it. §18 already records the
correct behaviour, so the document disagrees with itself rather than with the world.

**What the implementation did.** Nothing to the code: E4 and E5 carry no fill, exactly as specified.
The *reason* is now stated correctly in `eligibility.py`'s comment above them — a fill would assert
that the mask can carry `<NA>` when it cannot, which is what makes a reader stop believing the three
fills in `_classify` that are load-bearing; and it would become a real bug the moment either check is
rewritten as a comparison chain. `test_eligibility.py`'s
`test_the_isin_masks_carry_no_na_on_either_dtype_they_are_used_over` pins the property both checks
rest on, over both dtypes, so a pandas bump that made `isin` propagate fails loudly.

**Pros of doing it.** The spec is the sole source for Stage 4 and currently ships a false mechanism in
the section a reader consults before touching the fill discipline. Stage 5 and Stage 12 both add masks
over these columns and will read §4.2 for precedent.

**Cons.** It edits a spec that has already been reviewed and dated, and DoD 9 would be struck rather
than repaired — there is no cheap substitute cycle that demonstrates the same thing, because the code
is robust either way.

**Depends on / blocked by.** Nothing technical. It is the PI's document, so the amendment wants their
sign-off rather than a unilateral edit: **§4.2's mechanism sentence and DoD 9 both go, replaced by a
pointer to §3.1's third fact and to the test named above.** Nothing else in the spec moves — §3.1,
§18, §12.3 and the shipped code are all already correct.
